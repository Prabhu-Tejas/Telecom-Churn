# Telecom-Churn

Customer churn is one of the essential metrics that every business must evaluate to grow. In any service providing industry, when a customer decides to stop using the service by either cancelling the subscription or not paying for the service, we call this customer churn.
The churn rate is calculated by dividing the Lost Customers by Total Customers at the Start of Time.
Thus, a company churn rate must be as        low as possible, ideally 0%.
But why is it so important to calculate the churn rate? Does it affect the business if you lose around 5% of customers? Yes, the answer is that it costs more to acquire a new customer than retain the existing customers. Retaining the current customers, any company can spend less on operating costs needed to reach new customers.
The goal of churn management is to keep current customer as long as the company alive in the market.
Therefore, we will use advanced machine learning techniques to predict the potential churners who are about to leave a companyâ€™s service and take the necessary steps to prevent it.
This project aims to build a machine learning model that will help predict customers who are likely to churn and facilitate business to take necessary actions for reducing the churn.
